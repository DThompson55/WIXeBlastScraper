17 1 4 Type PARAGRAPH nodes []
17 1 5 Type PARAGRAPH nodes What we have learned from our conversations with chairs and members serving on UUSE committees is that congregants rarely reach out on their own to volunteer. However, when someone takes the initiative to reach out to an individual and discusses committee opportunities, then congregants are more likely to be open to serve. 
17 1 6 Type PARAGRAPH nodes []
17 1 7 Type PARAGRAPH nodes It is our hope that these recruiting sessions will provide an opportunity to reach out to more congregants and extend a personal invitation to serve the UUSE community. Please join us and consider volunteering for a committee.
17 1 8 Type PARAGRAPH nodes []
17 1 9 Type PARAGRAPH nodes This congregation cannot continue to sustain itself without volunteers. We desperately need more volunteers, and we need them now. Please consider making time in your busy schedules usually just a few hours a month to give back to a community that enriches our lives and community in so many ways.
17 1 10 Type PARAGRAPH nodes []
17 1 11 Type PARAGRAPH nodes We hope to see you there, but if you can't make it, please reach out to one of the NLDC members. Our contact information will be on the bulletin board in the program room soon.
